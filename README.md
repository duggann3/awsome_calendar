# django-calendar for COMP-41110
The objective of this excersise was to develop an online calendar that is cloud deployed. 
I followed the 2 tutorials below to build the calendar. 
I modified the calendar so that the static assets (css and image files) are retrieved from AWS S3
and the data is written to AWS RDS. 
I deployed this app on to EC2. Here is the address.
 
ec2-34-240-45-98.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8000/calendar
